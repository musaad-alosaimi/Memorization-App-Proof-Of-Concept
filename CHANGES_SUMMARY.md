### 1. **memorization-detail.page.ts** (222 lines)

#### Added:
- `RevealedWord` interface for tracking word state
- `revealedWords: RevealedWord[]` array
- `TextAligner` integration for word matching
- `initializeRevealedWords()` - Initialize words as hidden

### 2. **memorization-detail.page.html** (115 lines)

#### Changed:
```html
<!-- OLD: Color-coded user speech -->
<div class="word-matches">
  <span [class.correct]="match.isCorrect">{{ match.word }}</span>
</div>

<!-- NEW: Progressive revelation of reference text -->
<div class="revealed-words">
  <span [class.revealed]="word.isRevealed">
    {{ word.isRevealed ? word.word : '•••' }}
  </span>
</div>
```

#### Updated:

---

#### Added:
```scss
.revealed-words {
  // Progressive revelation styling

  }
}

@keyframes revealWord {
  // Smooth reveal animation
}
```

## 🎯 Behavior Changes

### Before:
| User Action | Display |
|-------------|---------|
| Speaks "الحمد لله" | Shows "الحمد لله" in green/red based on correctness |
| Continues speaking | Adds more colored words |
| Sees errors | Red-colored incorrect words |

### After:
| User Action | Display |
|-------------|---------|
| Initial state | All words as `•••` |
| Speaks "الحمد" correctly | Reveals "الحمد" in green |
| Speaks "لله" correctly | Reveals "لله" in green |
| Remaining words | Stay as `•••` until spoken |

## 🎨 Visual Comparison

### OLD System
```
Transcript Display:
[الحمد] [لله] [رب] [العالمين]
 green   green   red    hidden
  ✓       ✓      ✗      (not yet spoken)
```
Shows what user **said** with correctness marking

### NEW System
```
Progressive Revelation:
[الحمد] [لله] [•••] [•••]
 green  green  gray  gray
  ✓      ✓     ?     ?
```
Shows what user **should say** progressively revealed

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Word Matching Algorithm
```typescript
1. User speaks → transcript captured
2. TextAligner compares reference vs transcript
3. Find all MATCH operations in alignment
4. Reveal reference words up to last match
5. Keep remaining words hidden
```

### Reveal Logic
```typescript
// Only reveal words that match in sequence
for (token of alignment) {
  if (token.operation === MATCH) {
    revealWordsUpTo(token.referenceIndex);
  }
}
// Words revealed: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ... → N
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Old:
```
Accuracy: 75%
```

### New:
```
Progress: 3 / 4 words • Accuracy: 75%
```

Now shows:

- **Total words**: How many in hadith
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Progress bar**: Visual completion
