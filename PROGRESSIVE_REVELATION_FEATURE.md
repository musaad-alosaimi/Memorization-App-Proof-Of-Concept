# 📝 Progressive Word Revelation Feature

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented a **progressive word revelation system** that replaces the previous word-by-word feedback. Now, words from the reference text are only revealed as the user speaks them correctly, creating an interactive memorization experience.

---

## ✨ How It Works

### Before (Old System):
- User speaks
- System shows what was spoken with color coding (green = correct, red = incorrect)
- All spoken words are visible

### Now (Progressive Revelation):
- User speaks
- Words from the **reference text** are progressively revealed
- Only correctly spoken words are shown
- Remaining words stay hidden as `•••` placeholders
- Creates a "fill in the blanks" memorization experience

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Data Structure

```typescript
interface RevealedWord {
  word: string;         // The actual word from reference text
  isRevealed: boolean;  // Whether it's been spoken correctly
  isCorrect: boolean;   // Whether it matches expected word
  index: number;        // Position in reference text
}
```

### 2. Core Algorithm

```typescript
private updateRevealedWords(transcript: string) {
  // 1. Use TextAligner to compare reference vs spoken text
  const result = this.aligner.compare(this.item.content, transcript);
  
  // 2. Find all MATCH operations in alignment
  for (const token of result.alignment) {
    if (token.operation === AlignmentOperation.MATCH) {
      // 3. Reveal this word and all previous words
      revealWordsUpTo(token.referenceIndex);
    }
  }
  
  // 4. Only show words up to last correct match
}
```

### 3. Visual Display

```html
<div class="revealed-words">
  <span *ngFor="let revealedWord of revealedWords" 
        [class.revealed]="revealedWord.isRevealed"
        [class.hidden]="!revealedWord.isRevealed">
    {{ revealedWord.isRevealed ? revealedWord.word : '•••' }}
  </span>
</div>
```

### 4. Styling

- **Revealed words**: Green background, solid border, animated reveal
- **Hidden words**: Gray background, dashed border, `•••` placeholder
- **RTL support**: Proper Arabic text flow
- **Smooth animations**: Words animate in when revealed

## 🎨 Visual Experience

### Initial State
```
•••  •••  •••  •••  •••  •••  •••  •••
```
*All words hidden, waiting for user to speak*

### After Speaking First Word Correctly
```
الحمد  •••  •••  •••  •••  •••  •••  •••
```
*First word revealed with green background*

### After Speaking First Three Words Correctly
```
الحمد  لله  رب  •••  •••  •••  •••  •••
```
*Progressive revelation continues*

### Completed
```
الحمد  لله  رب  العالمين  الرحمن  الرحيم  ملك  يوم
```
*All words revealed in green*

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Progress Bar
Shows: `X / Y words` where:
- **X** = Number of revealed (correctly spoken) words
- **Y** = Total words in reference text

```
Progress: 5 / 12 words • Accuracy: 83%
```

### Accuracy Calculation
- Based on alignment comparison
- Accounts for word order and correctness
- Updates in real-time as user speaks

---

## 🔍 Integration with Text Alignment Library

The progressive revelation uses the text alignment library to:

1. **Compare texts**: Reference vs spoken transcript
2. **Find matches**: Identify correctly spoken words
3. **Determine position**: Know which word in sequence was matched
4. **Handle Arabic**: Uses custom normalizer for diacritics

```typescript
// Initialize with Arabic normalizer
this.aligner = new TextAligner({
  normalizer: (text: string) => this.normalizeArabicText(text)
});

// Compare and reveal
const result = this.aligner.compare(reference, transcript);
// Process alignment to reveal words
```

## 🎮 User Flow

### Step 1: Start Practice
```
User clicks "Start Practice" button
→ Microphone activates
→ All words show as •••
```

### Step 2: Speak Words
```
User speaks hadith text
→ Speech recognition captures transcript
→ System compares with reference
→ Matching words are revealed progressively
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress
```
User sees:
- Revealed words (green)
- Hidden words (•••)
- Progress bar (X/Y words)
- Accuracy percentage
```

### Step 4: View Details (Optional)
```
User clicks "Show Detailed Analysis"
→ Opens full alignment viewer
→ Shows token-level comparison
→ Displays WER metrics
→ Shows errors and corrections
```

### Step 5: Reset
```
User clicks "Reset Practice"
→ All words hidden again
→ Ready to practice again
```

## 🎨 Styling Details

### Revealed Words
```scss
.revealed {
  background-color: var(--ion-color-success-tint);
  color: var(--ion-color-success-shade);
  border: 2px solid var(--ion-color-success);
  animation: revealWord 0.5s ease-out;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(success-rgb, 0.3);
}
```

### Hidden Words
```scss
.hidden {
  background-color: var(--ion-color-medium-tint);
  color: var(--ion-color-medium);
  border: 2px dashed var(--ion-color-medium);
  opacity: 0.6;
  letter-spacing: 2px;  // For ••• spacing
}
```

### Animation
```scss
@keyframes revealWord {
  0% { opacity: 0; transform: scale(0.8); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  100% { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1); }
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Similarity Threshold
The system uses the alignment library's matching algorithm which:
- Normalizes Arabic text (removes diacritics)
- Compares word-by-word
- Requires exact match after normalization
- Handles character variants (أ → ا, ة → ه, etc.)

### Customization Options
You can adjust in `normalizeArabicText()`:
- Diacritics handling
- Character variant normalization
- Case sensitivity
- Special character handling
